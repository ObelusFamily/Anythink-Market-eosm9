## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_


## Setup Step 0 - Environment Setup

Ensure that you are logged into GitHub. 

Ensure that Docker desktop is running. 

Use your web browser to navigate to the Anything snack workspace (https://anythink.wilco.gg/chat/head-of-rd).
